## Overview 

Our mission was to create an interactive educational application that explores life in an extreme environment where chemosynthesis, rather than photosynthesis, forms the basis of the food chain. The project envisions a fictional world, Cloju 1003, with deep oceans where sunlight cannot reach, an atmosphere rich in methane and iron, and an ecosystem sustained by organisms that oxidize inorganic elements to obtain energy. The developed platform offers an immersive simulation of this planet through an interactive web page, with highlighted points that allow users to explore key topics about the functioning of this unique ecosystem.

Each interactive point reveals information on fundamental aspects of Cloju 1003, such as extreme environmental conditions, which explain how life thrives in the absence of sunlight, using chemical energy from sources like underwater volcanoes. Users learn about the ecosystem based on chemosynthesis, where bacteria oxidize iron and sulfur, and about organism adaptations, where life develops resistance to extreme pressure and temperatures. Additionally, the site details food chains sustained by chemolithotrophs, showing how larger organisms rely on symbionts that host these chemosynthetic bacteria, creating a web of ecological interactions.

Our goal is to provide an educational tool that sparks scientific curiosity and broadens understanding of the possibility of life in extreme environments. By assuming the role of an intergalactic explorer receiving a transmission about Cloju 1003, users navigate through a visually and sonically engaging environment designed to deepen their understanding of chemosynthesis and the symbiotic relationships that sustain life on this fictional world.

This project is significant because it challenges the audience to consider life in unconventional contexts, moving beyond Earth and expanding the boundaries of what we consider habitable. The interactive platform combines graphics, 3D models, and scientific data to create an immersive experience that showcases the resilience of life in hostile environments and teaches us about the infinite forms alien ecosystems may take.

By engaging the user in a process of discovery and reflection, we seek to promote a new perspective on biological diversity in the universe, encouraging a deeper appreciation of the interconnectedness between organisms and their environment. The project not only offers a glimpse into a fictional world but also inspires discussions about the viability of life in extreme conditions and the exploration of alien ecosystems that deviate from traditional habitability parameters.
